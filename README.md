Audio Visualizer
An interactive 3D Audio Visualizer built using HTML5, JavaScript, and Three.js. Upload audio files to create dynamic 3D visualizations that react in real-time.

Features
Customizable Geometries: Choose from multiple 3D shapes (spheres, cubes, stars, etc.).
Particle System: Enable particles and adjust their shape, count, speed, and movement.
Audio Interaction: Real-time 3D object movements and scaling based on audio frequencies.
Lighting Effects: Control multiple dynamic lights and choose different surface effects.
Camera Modes: Automate the camera with circular paths, zoom, random jumps, and more.
Shader Effects: Enable effects like glow, distortion, chromatic aberration, and motion blur.
Recording: Record the visualizer and audio directly in the browser.
